The key difference between an object-oriented programming (OOP) language and a non-object-oriented language lies in their fundamental approach to organizing and structuring code.

Object-oriented languages, such as Java, C++, Python, and C#, are designed around the concept of objects. An object is an instance of a class that encapsulates both data (attributes) and behavior (methods) related to that object. In OOP, the emphasis is on creating reusable and modular code by defining classes, which serve as blueprints for creating objects. This allows for the implementation of concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

On the other hand, non-object-oriented languages, also known as procedural languages, follow a procedural programming paradigm. Examples of procedural languages include C, Fortran, and Pascal. In procedural programming, the focus is on executing a series of procedures or functions to perform specific tasks. The code is organized around functions that operate on data, but the data and functions are not inherently linked together in objects.

Here are some key differences between object-oriented and non-object-oriented languages:

Encapsulation: Object-oriented languages provide encapsulation, which allows data and methods to be bundled together within an object, promoting data hiding and abstraction. Non-object-oriented languages typically lack this encapsulation mechanism.

Inheritance: Object-oriented languages support inheritance, where classes can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes, enabling code reuse and promoting a hierarchical relationship between classes. Non-object-oriented languages do not inherently provide inheritance mechanisms.

Polymorphism: Object-oriented languages facilitate polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to be treated uniformly, enabling flexibility and extensibility in code design. Non-object-oriented languages generally do not have built-in mechanisms for polymorphism.

Modularity and Reusability: Object-oriented languages promote modularity and reusability through the use of classes and objects. This enables code organization, separation of concerns, and easier maintenance. Non-object-oriented languages may lack the built-in mechanisms for achieving similar levels of modularity and reusability.

It's important to note that many languages may have elements of both object-oriented and procedural programming, allowing developers to choose different programming styles based on their needs.
